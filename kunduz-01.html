                        <h2>China's mission to Afghanistan, 4 months in</h2>
                        <h5>By Peter Kessler</h5>

                        <p>
                            The air in Kunduz is thick with tension. March’s chill cuts through the dust, but it's the pressure of the ongoing conflict that weighs on the soldiers, Chinese and Afghan alike. As the third month of the Chinese peacekeeping mission draws to a close, the reality of the situation on the ground is proving complex.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Chinese forces arrived in December, the plan was clear: stabilize the region after the collpase of the Taliban, rebuild local governance, and ensure access to basic resources and education. However, that mission has proven more difficult than anticipated, particularly as scattered remnants of various Taliban linked ideologues, armed with mostly American-made weapons abandoned in the region, continue to launch sporadic attacks on civilian infrastructure and rival factions.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-12">
                        <p>
                            The Chinese troops, under a mandate to avoid direct engagement with the enemy unless absolutely necessary, face an uncomfortable balancing act. Unlike the US-led interventions of the past, which focused on rooting out insurgents, the goal here is not to eliminate fighters but to strengthen local institutions. But for many of the peacekeepers, this non-confrontational stance often feels frustratingly passive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The task of building up and supporting the local Afghan forces has not been without its challenges. Divisions make coordination difficult, and there's the lingering fear that any misstep could destabilize the fragile peace. Local leaders, many of whom have their own vested interests, are wary of foreign involvement after years of conflict. The Chinese, for their part, are keen to avoid the mistakes of the past, where foreign intervention has often been seen as a source of instability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “We’re just here to help, to make sure the resources reach the people who need them.” says Major Zixin Hsiang, part of the strategic support unit. "Stability is the key to progress, and that’s what we’re here to provide.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The lack of infrastructure in Kunduz is also a constant obstacle. The roads are still filled with the remnants of war, making transportation of supplies a sometimes near-impossible task. The Chinese have worked to restore routes, but it’s a slow, grinding process, particularly as the fighting hampers efforts to secure these vital lifelines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite all of this, there are signs of progress. Clinics and schools are slowly reopening, though limited by the security situation. The peacekeepers and young Afghan military work together to escort teachers and medical professionals into the most volatile areas. The local economy, has begun to show small signs of growth, with trade across the border with neighboring Central Asian countries picking up, and the Chinese have been instrumental in helping to facilitate this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “It’s slow, but it’s progress,” says Corporal Wang, who has been helping rebuild local markets. “I think the people here are tired of the violence. They want something better.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yet, there remains a grim reality that the battle against the ideological remnants of the Taliban will not be won by military force alone. The Chinese mission is not about victory in the traditional sense, but about shifting the narrative from one of insurgency to one of governance and stability. The hardest part for the peacekeepers is convincing the local population, and their own soldiers, that this path is the right one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the March winds blow across Kunduz, there’s a growing sense of weariness among the Chinese peacekeepers, yet also a quiet resolve. The task at hand is not one of flashy victories, but of lasting peace—a peace that, for now, feels distant but perhaps not entirely out of reach.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While China tries to expand its influence and create new trade routes and economic opportunities in the region, for the men and women in uniform, this mission is a long road ahead, one with no near end in sight but the faint hope of a brighter future for locals, and for China’s rising global interests.
