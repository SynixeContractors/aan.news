                        <h3>Sunday, July 18th, 2032 by Robbert Babichlinksy</h3>

                        <p>
                            The fragile peace on the island of Lingor was shattered early Friday morning by a series of skirmish among the
                            bridges bordering the territory of the northern militia fighters and southern Lingor Government forces. The breakdown of peace 
                            was expected by many international organizations after the militias in the noth organized into a single force and clamied to be
                            the rightful controller of the islands they now call Sevincia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Elias Karmanlis, a local correspondent for AAN News, said the breakdown of the peace was the result of a "strategic
                            decision" by the northern militia and the government of the south. "The northern militia was not willing to accept the Lingor Government
                            as the legitimate state, so they decided to attack the south and the rest of the island. Their ultimate goal was to control the island
                            and to make it their own."
                        </p>
                        
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <p>
                            The preference shown to the southern coastal cities by the Lingor Government has been critized for years by
                            international organizations, including the United Nations. Almost all of the Island's wealthiest individuals have been
                            residing in the southern cities for many years, and the Lingor Government has been regulating the movement of the
                            wealth and power of the islanders. The disparity between the central cities and the southern cities has been a major
                            point of tension. This has led to the creation of the Sevincia Movement, which has been a popular movement in the
                            island for years. This movement has been organized into a single force, and is now pushing the Lingor Government
                            to recognize the right of the islanders to be the controller of the island. A poll conducted months ago by NGOs
                            shows that less than a quater of the islanders are in favor of the Sevincia Movement but more than half of the islanders
                            are in favor of reforms to the Lingor Government.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Meanwhile the Sevincia Movement has become much more organized and radical in recent months. The Lingor Government
                            was not prepared for the growing movement and rapidly lost effective control of territory as the movement was growing in strength.
                            While the Lingor Government still has control over most military assets, the Sevincia Movement has deployed a much larger
                            force. International Organizations are urging peace talks resume between the Lingor Government and the
                            Sevincia Movement as some fear this will become a long-term challenge.
                        </p><p>
                            Lingor has been a strategic partner of the United States for many years, and the United States has previously used it
                            as a support base for it's global security operations, noteably freedom of navigation exercises in waters claimed by China.
                            The United States has also been a major player in the international efforts to end the war in Lingor. Concerns are growing that
                            China and the SCO will back the northern militia forces to prevent the US a long-term ability to utilize the island nation.
                        </p><p>
                            Contractors in the south are deploying new Anti-Air sites to protect the territory from the northern miltiary forces. Israel and the
                            United States have announced that they are sending "Iron Dome" defense systems to the Lingor Government in the next few weeks.
                            The Iron Dome is a highly advanced technology that can protect the territory from the northern miltiary force's constant barrage of
                            rocket artillery and other missiles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many civilians have been killed in the conflict, including a number of children. Many of the residents have been forced to
                            leave their homes and live in temporary shelters. The Lingor Government has been forced to make tough decisions about
                            how to deal with the conflict. A large number of Lingor's wealthier idviduals have fled the island and are now living
                            in the United States and Australia. The economy of the island has been in a state of chaos for years and the rising tensions
                            has made it difficult for the Lingor Government to continue to operate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Elias Karmanlis will be in the island for a week. He will be embedding with a group 
                            of Sevincia Movement members and will be reporting on the conflict and the Lingor Government's response to the conflict.
                            While the conflict between the two sides of the conflict is going on, the Sevincia Movement is still working hard to organize itself and to fight for its future.
